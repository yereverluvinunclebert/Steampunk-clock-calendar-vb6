' resizing the main form via ctrl+mousewheel feeds back into prefs slider

' reszing bug, going small) when the automatic resize across screens is enabled

' change and test the main clock form slider values to make time changes more practical

' 00xx issue on small slider movements just trying to change the time

' when an alarm has been raised and an alarm toggle selected, if you move the slider forward to a future date/time, a double click does not revert the time to the current time.

' add time machine functionality

' disable chimes vs alarms disabled - new prefs

' create diagram of the program flow.

' about text VB6 / Twinbasic wip, check if the PSD is on the G5.

' tmrTickingSound_Timer timer to allow a sound sequence of ticks to be played, needs replacing with a timed tick that corresponds with pendulum movement

' rationalise SliderFreed,  SliderEnabled, SliderInTransit

' sliderSet movement should cause asynch. sounds rather than causing a timer to call the sound in the background.
