NOTE:

When the RC6.DLL and RC6widgets.dll are registered elsewhere within another widget, then this widget will compile but not run. 
In this case, the two DLLs in the local BIN folder need to be registered using the two Olaf-supplied scripts.


Tasks to do:
============

' when an alarm has been raised and an alarm toggle selected, if you move the slider forward to a future date/time, a double click does not revert the time to the current time.
- confirmed

' 00xx issue on small slider movements just trying to change the time

' add time machine functionality

' about text VB6 / Twinbasic wip, check if the PSD is on the G5.

' combine a new counter-rotating sound recording the current Konfabulator widget.

' clockform.refresh or overlaywidget.refresh?

' sliderSet movement should cause asynch. sounds rather than causing a timer to call the sound in the background.

' add another overlay that handles the animation of the pendulum alone that can run at a much higher frequency and reducing CPU usage overall.

' tmrTickingSound_Timer timer, a sound sequence of ticks to be played, needs replacing with a timed tick that corresponds with pendulum movement

' replace the dropdown comboxes for the date selection with Krool's date/time calendar

' create diagram of the program flow.

' investigate the accumulating shadow when moving across the transparent surface of the screen

' shadow behind cwlabel background when background screen lowered, 1. try adding a refresh, 2, try another control

' rubberduck the code

' look at Olaf's pendulum code - if the pendulum swinging is still using too much CPU after the new overlay

' the asynch sounds will not currently operate outside a timer, confirmed - research as to why

' Test the help drop down, the weekday and alarm tills and other items that have other items below them to see how they react with this code in cwAlpha.cls:
